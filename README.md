# War-Game
#Rules:
1) A player and a computer plays the top card of their deck (size 26)
2) if the player card is a higher rank than the computer card then the player wins a card and adds the card ot their deck
3) if the computer is higher than the person has a choice of drawing and betting another card. If the sum of the two new cards are less than or equal the card of the computer then the player wins the computer card and adds it to their hand. If it is greater than the computer's card then the computer wins the two cards the player betted. The two cards go to the bottom of the computers deck
4) if the ranks are tied for both cards then it will go into war mode. For war mode, each player bets an additional 3 cards. The computer and player then draws a card and compares the value. The person with the higher rank wins all 10 cards. If tied then it wars again for another 3 cards betted until there is a winner.
5) repeat until the player or computer is out of cards
